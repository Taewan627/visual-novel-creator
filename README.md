**Visual Novel Creator** is an AI-powered tool that allows users to design and generate interactive visual novels directly in the browser.  
It combines automated story generation, scene management, and character expression control — all in an intuitive drag-and-drop editor.

Users can build complete branching stories with a clear **scene tree**, generate dialogues and backgrounds with AI,  
and finally **export the result to Ren’Py (.rpy)** to run as a playable game.
